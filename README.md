Main objective of the program is to find the average of pixels inside squareSize x squareSize square and make all this pixels equal to value found from averaging. Program also allows a choice of using Single Thread or Multi Thread for the process. The image, square size and the thread mode is inputted by the user.

Multithhreading here allows calculations to be done parallelly with the help of the cores, depending on the number of the cores the CPU has in a particular computer.

The program is written with C++ with OpenCv library. It requires opencv_world454d.dll. However, its size is too large for GitHub. Therefore, the program is uploaded without dll.

To test the program, /ConcurrencyTask/x64/Debug/ConcurrencyTask.exe should be run. When running, the program will require full image path  to the image that is going to be handled, and the result is saved in result.jpg.
